Problem
-------
  SCAP Compliance Checker recently appears with false positives for controls confirmed as changed via Group Policy.
  This is due to SCC looking for the controls in the wrong location in the registry Microsoft Edge entries.
  SCC Registry checks key: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge
  Edge key:                HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\MicrosoftEdge

Fix Instructions
----------------
1. Ensure your group policy settings are the same as in the XCCDF results "fix text" section of your SCC results.
  NOTE: IMPORTING THE REGISTRY FILES WILL FIX THE SCAN RESULTS BUT DO NOT ACTUALLY MAKE CHANGES TO YOUR MICROSOFT EDGE SETTINGS. With that being said, ensure you perform step 1.
2. Open Registry Editor.
3. Select File > Import...
4. Import Edge.reg file.
5. Rerun SCAP scans.
